        <h1 class="quote"><br><br>“No man will be a sailor who has contrivance <br>enough to get himself into a jail; for being in a ship is being in a jail, with the chance of being drowned… a man in a jail has more room, better food, and commonly better company.”<br><br>— Dr Samuel Johnson</h1>

        <p>Ships nowadays are more comfortable than those in Dr Johnson’s time.<br>Even so, the sea remains an unforgiving environment. Once you leave port, you’re trapped. Lock twenty strangers in a large house and you have some idea of daily life at sea. Now, add in broken sleep and the many ways to die if someone makes a mistake, and you’ll start to understand why seafarers have a very particular view of the world.</p>

        <p>I started working on a local ferry when I was fourteen, then moved to traditional sailing ships and on to cargo ships. Many lessons I learned don’t apply to life ashore — there’s not much call for safe launching of lifeboats or working in a bosun’s chair when you have an office job. However, seafarers are people too. Living for months in close-quarters with a multi-national crew teaches us to live and work together in ways that are uncommon ashore.</p>

        <p>Here are 10 of the most important life lessons from my last 26 years at sea.</p>


        <! -- ITEM #1 -->

        <h2>1. Sleep matters.</h2>

        <p>A tired crew is a grumpy, inefficient and dangerous crew. The <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/SPC2004.pdf">NTSB</a> points out, “Fatigue impacts every aspect of human performance, including decision-making, reaction time, and comprehension…”</p>

        <p>By law, I’m entitled to 77 hours of rest a week. That’s split into no more than two periods a day, one of which must be at least 6 hours in length. Sleep quickly becomes critical.</p>

        <p>Living in a moving steel box, there are innumerable unavoidable factors that keep us awake; the least we can do is avoid the avoidable factors — consideration is the key. If consideration isn’t your thing, how about self-interest? A well-rested shipmate is less likely to kill you.</p>

        <p>Use door handles to close doors quietly, or use latches to hold them open. Use headphones to listen to music so your crewmate can to sleep. Walk gently in the accommodation so your steps don’t resound through the ship. When you call someone to wake them for watch, ensure you have the right cabin first. And if you have a cabin window, find some cardboard to tape over it — no-one sleeps well with the lights on.</p>


        <! -- ITEM #2 -->

        <h2>2. Shouting and screaming doesn’t help.</h2>

        <p>We were due to leave port. The captain was sorting out the paperwork, and I was supervising the discharge of the last of the cargo. When we were done, I assigned someone to close the hatches then went to report to the captain. As I walked away, a crash reverberated through the ship. Someone had derailed the crane and dropped a hatch cover into the hatch, puncturing a fuel tank.</p>

        <p>I confirmed that the hatch cover hadn’t penetrated the hull, then told the captain we wouldn’t be leaving on time. He didn’t shout and swear. He didn’t complain about the crew’s competence. He coolly sorted things out with the agent, then put on his overalls and came out to help.</p>

        <p>Yelling, complaining, and losing your temper just slows things down. It shames people and puts them on the defensive. Worse, it makes it more likely that everyone will try to cover-up their mistakes in the future.</p>

        <p>Afterwards, I had a quiet word with the crew member. They already knew how badly they’d messed up — they didn’t need to be told. And after that episode, they were the most conscientious crane driver on board.</p>

        <p>We all screw up. The last time you made a critical mistake, did you really need your boss to tell you what you did wrong?</p>


        <! -- ITEM #3 -->

        <h2>3. Ignorance is curable.</h2>
        
        <p>“Do you know how to enter a passage plan into the ECDIS?” I asked the new second mate.<br>“Yes, of course,” was his cocky response.<br>Ten minutes later, I wandered past to check. He’d somehow deleted the last six months of voyage records.</p>

        <p>People worry that they’ll look silly if they ask a question. I respond that they’ll look even sillier if they screw it up because they were too scared to ask. In meetings, I know people are reluctant to admit ignorance in public. To bypass that problem, I ask obvious questions even when I already know the answers.</p>

        <p>The goal is for everyone to know what’s going on and to feel comfortable asking. If I can think of the question, then someone in the room probably needs the answer.</p>


        <! -- ITEM #4 -->

        <h2>4. Take responsibility.</h2>

        <p>“Chief, the anchor windlass is leaking oil,” he reported after completing his rounds.<br>“Okay, what have you done about it?” I asked. I expected him to have shut down and isolated the hydraulics and covered the oil with kitty litter.<br>“Reported it to you,” was his bemused response.</p>

        <p>While “tell the duty officer” is one step in the “how to deal with an oil leak” procedure, I expect trained professionals to take responsibility for fixing simple problems.</p>

        <p>Compare that with a report from a crew member on another ship: “There was smoke coming out of the AC room. I checked, but it looks like it’s just the fan belt again. I’ve posted a fire watch and called the duty engineer. Is there anything else I need to do?”</p>

        <p>Those men both held the same rank, but only one showed initiative and took responsibility. I supervise one more closely than the other; he still doesn’t understand why.</p>


        <! -- ITEM #5 -->

        <h2>5. Systems and checklists are the keys to a peaceful life.</h2>

        <p>As a teenager, all paperwork sucked. Now I’ve grown up, and a well-designed system is a thing of beauty. Well-functioning systems take the stress out of life. There’s no guesswork, no drastic changes every time a new captain arrives. And I can talk for hours about well-written checklists! Even if you’re exhausted, pre-arrival checks in the small hours of the morning are easy with a well-thought-out checklist.</p>

        <p>I even have checklists and a planned maintenance system at home. No more wondering when I last inspected the roof or changed the cockroach bait. No more sitting on the plane asking myself whether I remembered to turn off the power and hot water cylinder before I left home for a six-month voyage— that’s all in my pre-departure checklist!</p>


        <! -- ITEM #6 -->

        <h2>6. Speak out.</h2>

        <h2 class="quote">“He refused despite threats of legal action, threats to have him demoted, and threats to have him fired. He refused to risk the lives of his crew just to save the company money.”</h2>

        <p>If you see a problem, say something. Loudly. And clearly. Stick to your guns. It’s intimidating to insist that people listen to you. Do you know what’s more intimidating? Having to live with an avoidable death or serious injury on your conscience.</p>

        <p>I was on a ship loading rapeseed in a small port. We had a very narrow departure window. If we didn’t make it out at high water, we’d be stuck for months. With a tight deadline, of course, we had a cargo delay.</p>

        <p>Rapeseed flows like water. If the cargo hold isn’t full and the ship rolls, the cargo shifts into the empty space. At worst, the ship capsizes. Since the cargo was delayed, the port authorities and the company tried to force us to leave with a half-empty ship.</p>

        <p>The captain refused. Vehemently. He refused despite threats of legal action, threats to have him demoted, and threats to have him fired. He refused to risk the lives of his crew just to save the company money.</p>

        <p>That captain always insisted we speak up, and he modelled the behaviour he wanted to see. He earned our complete respect.</p>


        <! -- ITEM #7 -->

        <h2>7. Different cultures communicate differently.</h2>

        <p>I’m Australian. I was serving with a Japanese officer. I’m used to people being very direct. He was not. One day he called me on the radio. “If you’re not too busy and you have a few minutes, I need some help on deck 7, starboard side, if you don’t mind too much.” He sounded quite calm. I almost replied, “I’ll be there in a few minutes — let me finish this report.” Fortunately, I didn’t.</p>

        <p>When I arrived, our rescue boat was in the water. The engine had died, and the boat (and our crew) were being swept towards the harbour entrance.</p>

        <p>We recovered the boat — and the crew. And I learned that when a Japanese officer asks for help, “…if you’re not too busy,” they mean, “Right now!”</p>

        <p>The point isn’t that my way is right and his way is wrong. The point is that we need to be aware of the differences in communication styles. That ship had between fifty and sixty nationalities on board; without a solid grasp of the fact that communication varies between cultures, we wouldn’t be able to function.</p>


        <! -- ITEM #8 -->

        <h2>8. There are two ways to learn.</h2>

        <p>Everyone has something to teach you. From some, I’ve learned how to do a job; from others, I’ve learned how not to do it.</p>

        <p>“When in doubt, call the captain.” The golden rule for bridge watchkeeping officers is. Of course, it works better if the captain is actually <i>competent.</i></p>

        <p>I had the misfortune to sail with a captain who, when called, would <i>always</i> make the situation worse. He’d make assumptions, jump to conclusions, give orders that didn’t make sense, then walk away and leave us to resolve the problems he’d created.</p>

        <p>We went to great lengths to avoid calling him. We’d leave it until the last possible moment, hoping to avoid calling him. Of course, that meant that when we did call him, the situation was already dire.</p>

        <p>That captain taught me the importance of taking a moment to assess the situation. I learned that if the solution appears obvious, I’m missing something — if it was that obvious, my crew would have sorted it out themselves rather than calling me.</p>

        <p>Even the worst captain I’ve sailed with had a lesson to teach. No matter how awful the experience was, if I learned the lesson then something positive came of the experience.</p>


        <! -- ITEM #9 -->

        <h2>9. My brain is my responsibility.</h2>

        <p>I literally get paid to stare out of the window and make sure we don’t crash. It’s about 99% boredom, 1% panic. The problem is that it’s tough to switch from staring at the stars to coordinating a complex emergency response.</p>

        <p>For me, the key is not letting my brain drift into neutral. To avoid this, I spend the first part of each watch running through predictable emergencies in detail. If I can remember the checklist, I locate all the relevant equipment. If I can find the equipment, I review how to use it. If I know that, I move on to mentally planning which crew members I’d assign to which tasks, based on their strengths and weaknesses.</p>

        <p>When I’ve had enough of that, I speculate about unpredictable (and unrealistic) emergencies like aliens landing on deck, or being boarded by zombies. It livens things up and helps me to consider options that I wouldn’t normally think of. Believe it or not, that helps deal with the unpredictability of genuine emergencies.</p>

        <p>It’s easy to switch from mental to physical emergency response because my brain is already functioning. And because I’ve planned the response ahead of time, I don’t have to waste time thinking about it when it actually happens.<br><br></p>

        <! -- ITEM #10 -->

        <h2>10. I’m not here to be popular.</h2>

        <p>“She’s anti-smoking, anti-drinking, anti-every-f*#%ing thing, but she’s good at her job.”<br>He didn’t know I was listening. It was the best compliment he could have given me.<br>I often don’t get on with my crew. Apart from anything else, many males object to having female seafarers on board. I’m fine with that. As long as we can manage professional respect, we can function.</p>

        <p>In an emergency, I have to trust my crew with my life, and they have to trust me with theirs. We don’t have to <i>lik</i>e each other. I’d much rather sail with a professional crew who hate my guts than a congenial bunch of incompetents.</p>

        
        <! -- BONUS ITEM -->

        <h2>Bonus tip: Thank the cook.</h2>

        <p>We choose to join a ship. After that, our most basic choices are no longer our own. We eat what we’re given when it’s available. Too many people complain about things they don’t like, but forget to thank the cook for the food they do like. Trust me, if the cook takes a day off, we’ll all miss them.</p>

        <p>By law, the captain is the most important person on board. In reality, it’s the cook. Thank them for their work, stay on their good side, and you’ll be set.</p>

        <p>We’re all people, regardless of race, gender and nationality. No matter what our differences, seafarers are all in the same boat — often literally. We have more in common than we have differences, and we have no choice but to work together. That means we have to live together in relative peace. That’s becoming less common in today’s world.</p>
