# article-recreation
This was a formative assessment for our IT103P (Web Programming) course during my 2nd year as a Computer Science student.
We were given the following instructions:

-------

Using HTML and CSS, recreate an article of your choosing (similar to what I did in the lessons).

I suggest finding an article from Medium because they utilize a minimalistic design, making it easier to create.
Try to match it as close as possible.

Example: https://medium.com/the-ascent/7-things-you-should-try-never-to-do-in-the-morning-2ccd8f7ac89d

Do not try to copy the articles' html itself because it is very obvious, I will find out, and you will fail this quiz. 
Write the code yourself using the concepts that I have taught in class.

Put your HTML and CSS files in a zip file and submit them.
